## Installing dependencies
For correct application running you need to install necessary dependencies (only once), such us: python 3.8, nodejs, npm, pip and also all dependencies from requirements.txt for backend part and all dependencies from package.json for frontend part. Run following bash script from root directory of project to install all necessary dependencies in one action:
 `./run-scripts/install-main-dependencies`

## Local app run
1. In terminal from root directory of project execute `./run-scripts/run-backend` (for running backend)
2. In other terminal tab from root directory of project execute `./run-scripts/run-frontend` (for running frontend)
3. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to view app with interface or use http://localhost:5000 for local api calls.
